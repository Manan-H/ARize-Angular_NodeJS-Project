What is great about ARize, is that we provide a user-free platform, which allows regular users to create an AR experience for business purposes or just for fun. With our platform you can scan your environment and see different augmented objects (3D model - image - video) in your real world and interact with them. We have developed different types of augmented reality apps (Marker Base or Marker Less), besides we have developed different products on AR technology, like video mapping, hidden museum and AR games (by order).
